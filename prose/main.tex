\chapter{The \PROSE Framework}
\label{ch:prose}

In this section, I describe the methodology of program synthesis the \PROSE framework: \emph{deductive synthesis
driven by domain-specific witness functions}.
I first introduce the notion of witness functions informally in \Cref{sec:prose:intuition}, deriving it from various
instances of prior work in PBE (such as FlashFill and FlashExtract).
Then, in \Cref{sec:prose:wf}, I give a formal definition of witness functions, as well as a comprehensive review of
their usage in PROSE-based PBE technologies.
\Cref{sec:prose:algorithm} presents the main synthesis algorithm of PROSE, \emph{deductive search}.\footnote{Also known
    in the literature as \emph{divide-and-conquer search}, \emph{top-down search}, and \emph{backpropagation-based
    search} (not to be confused with the backpropagation algorithm for training neural
    networks~\cite{chauvin1995backpropagation}, although this name was inspired by similarities between the two
techniques).}
In \Cref{sec:prose:evaluation}, I show its evaluation on $12$+ real-life case studies -- PBE technologies developed on top
of the framework.
Finally, \Cref{sec:prose:discussion} discusses various limitations and extensions to the algorithm.
