\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

Program synthesis is the task of finding a program in the underlying language that satisfies a given user intent,
expressed in the form of some specification~\cite{gulwani2010dimensions}.
The origin of the idea of program synthesis dates back to the early days of AI~\cite{green69,waldinger69}, with the
original aim of automatizing the programming experience, given a formal specification of the desired software.
In addition, has applications to a wide variety of domains,
including robotics~\cite{kuniyoshi1994learning}, software development~\cite{kuncak2012software}, and
biology~\cite{synthesis:biological}.
However, the true potential of this area still remains elusive due to its inherent complexity:
because of the huge and arbitrary nature of the underlying state space of possible programs, program synthesis is
an incredibly hard combinatorial search problem.

In the last decade, synthesis-based technologies have resurged in popularity,
thanks to the recent advancements in efficient search algorithms, constraint solving, and stochastic techniques like
deep learning.
The key insight to scaling program synthesis is \emph{syntactic guidance}, first formalized universally as a
\emph{syntax-guided synthesis} (SyGuS) problem~\cite{sygus}.
Instead of a general-purpose programming language, SyGuS-based techniques perform their search in a
\emph{domain-specific language} (DSL).
A DSL is a syntactic restriction on the search space, which narrows it down to only those programs that are practical in
a certain application domain.
The SyGuS initiative consists in development of general-purpose synthesis algorithms that take as input a DSL and a
formal specification $\spec$, and find a program in the DSL that satisfies~$\spec$.
However, generality of such algorithms implies that (a) their specification format has to be limited to a common set of
formally defined \emph{theories} (currently based on the SMT-LIB format~\cite{smtlib}), and (b) they cannot leverage any
domain-specific algorithmic insights for improving synthesis performance on a given DSL.
As a result, at the moment performance of all SyGuS algorithms is inapplicable in real-life industrial settings even for
simplest tasks~\cite{bodik:layout,andersen:procedural,singh2012synthesizing}.

This state of affairs in mass-market industrial deployment of program synthesis has changed in \citeyear{flashfill}
thanks to FlashFill~\cite{flashfill}, a technology for automatic synthesis of string
transformations, available in Microsoft Excel 2013.
FlashFill was widely successful and appraised, thanks to a combination of important features:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item It aids with the widespread problem of \emph{data wrangling} --- transforming, cleaning, and reshaping a
        dataset from a semi-structured form into a structured one, amenable to automated
        processing~\cite{kandel2012enterprise}.
    \item It is driven by input-output examples of the desired transformation's behavior, which makes it easily
        accessible to end users.
    \item It is able to synthesize the desired transformation from as few as 1-3 examples of intent, and in a fraction
        of a second.
\end{itemize}

The success of FlashFill has prompted a series of successor technologies based on the same methodology --
\emph{programming by examples} (PBE).
These include FlashExtract~\cite{flashextract} -- a technology for automatic extraction of data from semi-structured log
files and webpages, FlashRelate~\cite{flashrelate} -- a technology for automatic reshaping of spreadsheets into a
relational format, and others.
Many of these technologies were also deployed in mass-market products, including Microsoft Windows 10, Cortana,
Exchange, PowerShell, and Azure Log Analytics.

Unfortunately, the engineering effort associated with implementation and deployment of a domain-specific PBE-based
technology is substantial.
Domain-specific synthesis applications implement program synthesis algorithms that are designed specifically for a given
DSL, and are tightly dependent on its structure.
This approach drastically improves synthesis performance, but also limits industrial applicability of the resulting
codebase.
Specifically, the underlying DSL is hard to extend because even small DSL changes might require non-trivial changes
to the synthesis algorithm and implementation.
Both the original implementation of a PBE-based synthesizer and the subsequent software evolution may take up to 1-2
man-years of effort and require PhD-level expertise in program synthesis.

In this work, I show that most domain-specific PBE-based synthesis applications produced in the last
decade~\cite{smartedit,miller:colorful,flashfill,flashextract,flashrelate,flashnormalize,vldb12:semantic,andersen:procedural,pldi15:swarat,pldi15:osera,harris2011spreadsheet,singh2012synthesizing}
can be cast as instance of one common methodology.
We decomposed all of them into:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item A set of domain-specific insights that describe properties of the application domain (i.e. the DSL).
    \item A general-purpose meta-algorithm that is parameterized with a DSL and the aforementioned insights.
\end{enumerate}
The algorithm can be written independently once and for all domains.
The insights are domain-specific, but independent of the chosen synthesis strategies, thus can be defined by
domain experts and software engineers.

We have implemented this common algorithm as PROSE framework (``PROgram Synthesis using
Examples'').\footnote{\url{https://microsoft.github.io/prose}}

\paragraph{Thesis Statement:}
\emph{
    Interactive example-driven program synthesis for arbitrary data-centric domains can be expressed as one common
    domain-agnostic top-down search algorithm parameterized by concise domain-specific deduction procedures.
    Such decomposition makes program synthesizers scale to real-life application domains, enables domain-agnostic
    intent disambiguation techniques, incremental synthesis sessions, and mass-market deployment of the derived
    technologies.
