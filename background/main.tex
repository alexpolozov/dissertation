\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}
This section presents the preliminaries that are used throughout the thesis.
First, I introduce FlashFill~\cite{flashfill} and FlashExtract \cite{flashextract}, two instances of prior
synthesis work that are generalized by the PROSE framework.
Then, I use them to describe the notation for PROSE DSLs and illustrate it on real-life motivating examples.
